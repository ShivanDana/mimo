All notable changes to mimo will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- Hook-based memory system with 6 hooks:
  - `statusline-memory.sh` — ANSI progress bar with context % and threshold indicators
  - `memory-gate.sh` — Stop hook that blocks exit when memory save is needed
  - `precompact-save.sh` — Backs up transcript before compaction
  - `session-start.sh` — Resets state and injects memory context on startup/resume
  - `session-start-compact.sh` — Lightweight context injection after compaction
  - `session-end-backup.sh` — Final transcript backup on session exit
- Two-tier memory architecture:
  - `CLAUDE.md` — compact index (auto-loaded by Claude Code)
  - `CLAUDE-FULL.md` — deep archive with detailed session logs
- Automatic checkpoints at 50% context usage
- Full memory save at 80% context usage
- `mimo` CLI with `init`, `status`, `version`, `uninstall` commands
- One-line installer with safe `settings.json` merging
- Idempotent install/uninstall (safe to run repeatedly)
- Coexistence with user's existing Claude Code hooks
